# Anveshak - Phishing Email Detection System

## 🎯 Project Overview

**Anveshak** is an intelligent phishing email detection system that uses machine learning to identify and flag suspicious emails. The project features a user-friendly web dashboard built with Streamlit that allows users to analyze email content in real-time.

## 🚀 Features

- **Real-time Email Analysis**: Paste raw email content and get instant phishing detection results
- **Machine Learning Model**: Trained on spam/ham datasets for accurate detection
- **Feature Extraction**: Analyzes multiple email characteristics including:
  - Body and subject length
  - Suspicious keyword detection
  - URL count analysis
  - Special character frequency
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provides confidence percentages for predictions
- **User-friendly Interface**: Clean, intuitive web dashboard

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone or Download the Project
```bash
# If you have the project files, navigate to the project directory
cd Anveshak-1
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the Application
```bash
cd Conclave
python -m streamlit run Anveshak.py
```

### 4. Access the Dashboard
Once the application starts, it will automatically open in your default web browser at:
```
http://localhost:8501
```

## 🎮 How to Use

1. **Open the Dashboard**: Navigate to the URL shown in your terminal (usually http://localhost:8501)

2. **Paste Email Content**: Copy and paste the complete email content (including headers) into the text area

3. **Analyze**: Click the "Check Email" button to run the analysis

4. **View Results**: The system will display:
   - **Safe** (green) - Email appears legitimate
   - **Phishing** (red) - Email is likely a phishing attempt
   - Confidence percentage for the prediction
